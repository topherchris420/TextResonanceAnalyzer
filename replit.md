# NLP Symbolic Resonance Analyzer

## Project Overview
A sophisticated Flask web application that performs real-time NLP analysis and generates interactive tree visualizations of text symbolic resonance patterns. The application features sentiment analysis, entity recognition, relationship mapping, and an engaging user interface with smooth animations and particle effects.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with Python 3.11
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy (en_core_web_sm model), TextBlob
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS, D3.js for tree visualization
- **Styling**: Dark theme with gradient backgrounds and glowing effects
- **Animation**: CSS animations, JavaScript particle systems, typewriter effects

## Key Features
1. **Real-time Text Analysis**
   - Sentiment analysis with polarity and subjectivity scoring
   - Named entity recognition
   - Semantic relationship extraction
   - Word and sentence counting

2. **Interactive Tree Visualization**
   - D3.js-powered symbolic resonance tree
   - Collapsible/expandable nodes
   - Color-coded node types (entities, relationships, themes)
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Zoom and pan functionality

3. **Enhanced UX**
   - Debounced input for performance
   - Typing indicators and loading states
   - Sample text buttons for quick testing
   - Particle background effects
   - Success animations
   - Progress bars with shimmer effects
   - Hover effects and micro-interactions

4. **Attribution**
